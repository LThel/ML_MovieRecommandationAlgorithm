# **Movie Recommandation System - Machine Learning**
# Goal :
Working for a movie theater, we developed a recommandation engine for their customers.
# What we did : 
We investigate a movie database (from Imdb (https://datasets.imdbws.com/)(the documentation : https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) and rotten tomatoes for critics (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset)), explore it and create 2
recommendation algorithms (One base on a movie you like, the other on a movie you hate).
